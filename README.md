# An Angular Directive Howto presentation.

Follow along from heroku: 

To run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sebastienwindal/AngularDirectivesHowTo.git
```

then from the AngularDirectivesHowTo folder, install local dependency :

```bash
npm install
```

And run it:

```bash
grunt server
```

Alternatively, you can, after the initial clone, go to the AngularDirectivesHowTo/app folder
and run a web server of your choice...

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

or if you have node-static installed (npm install -g node-static):

```bash
static
```
